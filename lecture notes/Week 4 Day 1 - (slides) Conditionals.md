This is worth memorizing:
- Name Errors --> check that you're calling something that exists
- Issues with output from function --> check return statement, then body of function

This is also worth memorizing - helps to avoid being confused about what to put inside the function (avoid (re)defining the parameters in the body of the code unnecessarily)

Any questions about functions?
