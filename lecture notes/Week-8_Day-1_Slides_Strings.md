Important because at each step in the loop, the iteration variable will contain a *value* from the sequence, not an index. IN SOME CASES, if you are looping through a set of numbers you want to use as indices, then I suppose this makes sense, but it's still looping through *values* in that sequence.

Good chunk of folks need things to slow down a bit. Will try to make sure whatever I say that it is important is also written. Would strongly recommend also reaching out over office hours or email to review whatever you're confused about from the past!

Need more in-class practice:
- "I do think that there could be more learning checks, more than JUST the in class coding on Thursdays. As soon as we learn something, we have a little like 10-15 practice portion on the notebook immediately to go over what we just learned and put it into actual practice."
- "More in class programming would be nice"

We're working on it! Will try to work in more in-class programming today. And add more exercises for next module.
