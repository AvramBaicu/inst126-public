### LC-09 review

Error traces and checking outputs are *strategies* that you can deploy alongside others, but the core idea is making sure you have a **mental model** of your program, which includes your intent, as well as what the program is actually doing, and whether/where they align/misalign.

---

Why is articulating and iterating on this mental model the fundamental concept of debugging?

You need a clear mental model of your intent and the program in order to test various fixes to bring your intent and the program into alignment. 

If you don't have that, then you devolve into trial and error.

Sample size getting very low. Not sure how to interpret this. Please respond!

Someone mentioned struggling with methods (e.g., `.append()`). I'll try to emphasize that today. You'll need a good understanding of that for a lot of your programs.
